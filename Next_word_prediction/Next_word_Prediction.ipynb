    "# Next Word Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of advanced natural language processing, predictive text systems have become an integral part of user interfaces, enhancing user experience by providing suggestions and auto-completing text inputs. This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a next word prediction system using an N-gram model with Good-Turing smoothing and interpolation techniques. An N-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model that predicts the next item in a sequence based on the previous items, making it a powerful tool for understanding and generating human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a robust word prediction system by leveraging statistical language modeling techniques. The N-gram model is trained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to learn the probabilities of sequences of words. To address the issue of zero probabilities for unseen N-grams, Good-Turing smoothing is applied, which adjusts the probability estimates for rare or unseen events. Additionally, interpolation combines the probabilities of different N-grams (e.g., bigrams, trigrams) to improve prediction accuracy. This combination of techniques ensures that the model can make accurate and reliable predictions, even when encountering new or uncommon word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for training and evaluating the N-gram model is included in this repository. Specifically, the following files are used:\n",
    "- `internet_archive_scifi_v3.txt`: This file is used for training the N-gram model. It contains a large corpus of science fiction text data from which the model learns the probabilities of word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the dataset at this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jannesklaas/scifi-stories-text-corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "This science fiction dataset will be utilized to complete sentences and generate text relevant to the genre, ensuring the model can capture the unique vocabulary and stylistic elements typical of science fiction narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the functionality of the environment, you may need to install some libraries not pre-installed in the CTPO environment but required for this notebook. Follow these steps to install the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your terminal or command prompt within the Jupyter notebook. Navigate to `File -> New -> Terminal` and type `bash` to get a shell compatible with the following commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the project directory where the notebook is to set up the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following commands to create and activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv --system-site-packages myvenv\n",
    "source myvenv/bin/activate\n",
    "pip3 install ipykernel\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myvenv --display-name=\"Python (myvenv)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the following command in the Jupyter notebook, make sure you are in the directory where the Jupyter Notebook and virtual environment is located. Load the newly created \"Python (myvenv)\" kernel. This ensures the `./` path is always current. You can use the `cd` command to change to your project directory and `pwd` to verify your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Note\n",
    "It is crucial to load the new \"myvenv\" kernel for the notebook to work correctly. If the new \"myvenv\" kernel is not loaded, the required libraries and environment settings will not be applied, and the notebook will not function as expected.\n",
