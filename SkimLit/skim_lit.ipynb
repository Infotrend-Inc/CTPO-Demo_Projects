    "# SkimLit: Skimming Literature with NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify sentences from scientific abstracts. The goal is to automate the extraction of important information from scientific papers, which is crucial for researchers and professionals who need to quickly review and understand the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**PubMed 20k RCT Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook utilizes text files from the `PubMed_20k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign` folder, which should be downloaded and stored in a `data` directory accessible by the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Download Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To access and set up the datasets, please follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `data` folder in your project directory if it doesn't already exist.\n",
    "2. Download the text files from the following Kaggle dataset link:\n",
    "   - [PubMed 20k RCT Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthewjansen/pubmed-200k-rtc?select=PubMed_200k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign) (ensure you comply with the dataset's usage rules).\n",
    "3. Place the downloaded text files into the `data` folder. This step ensures that all data files are ready to be accessed by the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introduction**: Overview of the project's aim and importance.\n",
    "- **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial analysis of the data to understand the distribution and nature of the dataset.\n",
    "- **Text Normalization**: Processing steps to clean and normalize the text data.\n",
    "- **Model Building**: Implementation of various models to classify sentences in scientific abstracts.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of the models' performance using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Install Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "- To enhance the functionality of the CTPO environment, you may need to install some libraries not pre-installed but required for this notebook. Follow these steps to install the necessary libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Create and Activate the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Open your terminal or command prompt within the jupyter notebook. `File -> New -> Terminal`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Navigate to the project directory where you want to set up the environment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Execute the following commands in a `bash` to create and activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python3 -m venv --system-site-packages myvenv #myvenv is name of virtual environment you can change it\n",
    "   source myvenv/bin/activate\n",
    "   pip3 install ipykernel\n",
    "   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myvenv --display-name=\"Python (myvenv)\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to load the new \"myvenv\" kernel for the notebook to work correctly. If the new \"myvenv\" kernel is not loaded, the required libraries and environment settings will not be applied, and the notebook will not function as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Install Required Libraries\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Before running the following command in jupyter notebook, make sure you are in the directory where the Jupyter Notebook and virtual environment is located. This ensures the ./ path is always current. You can use the cd command to change to your project directory and pwd to verify your current directory.\n",
